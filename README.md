Sales Campaign CRM Process with automation using Python and relevant APIs -

This Sales Campaign CRM Automation streamlines lead processing by integrating automated workflows for lead verification, outreach, and reporting. A Supervisor Agent manages task assignment, Agent A verifies lead details, and Agent B handles outreach and response tracking. Using APIs (Google Sheets, Gmail, Hunter.io, SendGrid) and automation tools (Zapier, Python scripts), the system ensures efficiency, reduces manual workload, and improves conversion rates. Beyond sales, this structured approach benefits customer support (ticketing workflows), HR (candidate outreach), and marketing (campaign management) by enhancing lead management, ensuring timely follow-ups, and increasing engagement.
